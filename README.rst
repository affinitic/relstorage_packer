Converter from CSV file to a multilingual IMS VDEX voacabulary XML file.

VDEX is a very good standardized format for multilingual vocabularies, 
ontologies, etc. It just sucks to create its XML manually. There is poor editor 
support. But everybody has Excel, well, but almost everybody nows how to create 
tables. So let the user create a sheet with a column of keys for each term and 
for each language a column with the translated terms value. 

Source Code
===========

The sources are in a GIT DVCS with its main branches at 
`github <http://github.com/bluedynamics/vdexcsv>`_.

We'd be happy to see many forks and pull-requests to make vdexcsv even better.
